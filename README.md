A Flutter project that is trying to bring a developer event app to manage and keep track of the I/O event.
App is currently using data for **Google I/O 2022**.

## Screenshots
Coming Soon
## To-do
Ultimately a Google I/O App should be using Google products so future plans will involve moving the data from local to Firebase such that we can source data from Firebase as well as have Authentication and store user-related content.

*No estimated time when these will be done*

**Short - term**
- [ ] Include local storage for saving user likes sessions using *Hive*
- [ ] Adopt navigator 2 with *go_router*
- [ ] State management: Riverpod


**Long Term**
- [ ] Include quick actions to navigate directly to page
- [ ] Move data and functionality to Firebase
